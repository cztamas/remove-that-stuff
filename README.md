# remove-that-stuff
Simple Chrome extension for removing annoying stuff from websites.

Hold down the `d` (as delete) button, then click on anything to remove it. The element to remove will be highlighted.

You can undo with `Ctrl+Z`, redo with `Ctrl+Y`.

Currently not working across iframes, maybe sometimes I will have time to upgrade it...
